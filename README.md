This branch is the source of the demo hosted at [https://kdjdev.github.io/3d-html/](https://kdjdev.github.io/3d-html/).

A quick note that the docs directory is not actually documentation, but rather the build files of the site. This directory is called "docs", instead of something like "dist", because for some reason GitHub Pages requires the root directory of your build to be "/docs".
